# Tic_Tac_Toe_Game_Project
This repository contains the implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game developed as part of the Embedded Systems course for 2nd year, 2nd term EECE students at Cairo University, under the supervision of Dr. Omar Nasr.

The project is implemented using C++ programming language and features comprehensive game mechanics that support both multiplayer and single-player modes. In multiplayer mode, two players can compete against each other, while the single-player mode allows users to challenge an intelligent AI opponent. To enhance the gaming experience, the AI system incorporates multiple difficulty levels ranging from beginner to expert, enabling players to select their preferred level of challenge and progressively improve their strategic skills.

The application utilizes a modern Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide an intuitive and engaging user experience, making the classic Tic Tac Toe game accessible and enjoyable for players of all ages.
